# EDA-San-Francisco-Government-
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on San Francisco government employees and their salaries aims to analyze and understand the salary distribution and demographic characteristics of employees working for the city government. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project involves loading and cleaning the dataset, performing statistical analyses, visualizing key insights through plots and charts, and drawing conclusions about salary trends, disparities, and potential factors influencing compensation. This EDA provides valuable insights for policymakers, HR professionals, and researchers interested in understanding the workforce dynamics and salary structures within the San Francisco government.
